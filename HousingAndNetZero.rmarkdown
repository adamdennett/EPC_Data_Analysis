## UK CO^2^ Emissions

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   The UK Government has legally binding targets under the Climate Change Act 2008 to reach 'net zero' carbon emissions by 2050

-   Carbon emissions are produced through demand for energy

    -   **directly** through burning gas, wood, coal, peat, oil for heat/cooking etc.
    -   **indirectly** through burning these things to produce electricity

-   **Residential buildings** currently account for about **13.7%** of the UK's total greenhouse gas emissions - heating, cooling + running applicances

-   While Greenhouse Gas emissions have reduced since 1990, housing is now responsible for a greater proportion of our total emissions than ever before - producing around **56 million tons of CO^2^** per year

## Leaky Homes

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In 2021, the National Housing Federation reported that a combination of gas central heating and poor insulation meant that as heat easily leaks from many of the UK's homes, it requires even more gas to heat them.

-   The average family or household in England is currently producing more CO^2^ every year by just living in their home than they are by driving their car!

-   Three in every five (60%) homeowners don't think their home energy use has much of an impact on carbon emissions. More than one in four homeowners (28%) have no plans to make "eco-upgrades" to their homes in the next ten years.

## How do we know how leaky our home is?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Energy Performance Certificates were introduced in England and Wales in August 2007
-   A valid certificate (they last for 10 years) is now required for any property sold or rented in the UK
-   Every property gets a current rating - A to G - alongside a potential rating, which relates to what it could achieve with better insulation, double glazing, etc.
-   EPCs are created by surveyors who use something called the 'Standard Assessment Procedure' (SAP) to rate the building. SAP accounts for things like:
    -   Size of building
    -   Age of Building
    -   Building materials used
    -   Glazing
    -   Heating and hot water type
    -   Type of lighting
-   The SAP is an imperfect science and prone to human error, but it's the best method currently available

## What does the government want?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   80% of the homes we will be living in in 2050 are already built now, so we need to focus on improving the housing stock we already have
-   The Clean Growth Strategy was published in October 2017 and includes several targets to improve energy efficiency:
    -   to upgrade all fuel poor homes to Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) **band C** by 2030;
    -   to upgrade as many homes as possible to EPC **band C** by 2035

But is this enough and how are they going to achieve it?

## Making homes more energy efficient + additional benefits & challenges

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   'Retrofitting' homes is the process of improving insulation, ventilation and air-tightness alongside upgrading heating (e.g. to heat-pumps), lighting and installing smart control devices. Doing all of this at once is known as 'Deep Retrofit.'
-   Retrofitting also has other benefits - for example, for health. The Building Research Establishment [estimates that poor housing costs the NHS £1.4bn per year in additional treatments](https://bregroup.com/news-insights/the-cost-of-poor-housing-to-the-nhs/), with excess cold causing the most problems.
-   A mass programme of retrofitting could also create thousands of jobs, benefiting the wider economy; and help improve our energy security, making us less reliant on imported fossil gas for heating
-   But, retrofitting is expensive (up-front cost) - [recent estimates](https://residential.jll.co.uk/insights/research/decarbonising-uk-housing-2024) are that the average cost of retrofitting a property to Grade C or above would cost ***£35,000*** - even basic insulation costs can run into many thousands of pounds.
-   Saving money on heating will eventually make this money back, but it could take many years

:::

## What needs to be done?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   With the cost of retrofit so expensive - and the route to doing it unclear for many people - proper incentives such as funding or tax incentives from central government alongside schemes to help home-owners need devising
-   The Insulate Britain pressure group highlights that UK government doesn't have a long-term strategy or funding mechanism to upgrade/retrofit homes to meet our climate commitments
-   Estimates that 1.5 homes per minute need to be retrofitted up until 2050 to hit our legally-binding net-zero target - something that we are currently far from achieving.

## What role can we as Geographers play in helping the transition?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   More or less energy efficient homes are not spread evenly across the country - some places and some types of neighbourhood are more or less likely to have energy efficient homes

-   If we can understand *where* the problem is most acute and how much we might need to do in different places, we can begin to put pressure on the government or the local countil to make better policy / invest funds in a more targeted way

-   If we can explain what the problem is in our local area, we stand a better chance of trying to solve it

-   We can contact our local councilors and MPs to ask them make improving housing in our area more of a priority

-   The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) collects and maintains data on every Energy Performance Certificate issued in England and Wales. The database is available as Open Data for anyone to explore and analyse.

-   The latest edition of the EPC dataset (Version 10) contains some 25 million records (some repeat entries) which equate to about 14 million residential properties in the England and Wales - just over 50% of the 26.7 million that exist.

-   More recent entries to the EPC database feature a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) which enables us locate precisely where each property is located

## Some intitial analysis of the EPC dataset

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   We analysed 14m properties in the EPC dataset
-   Energy Efficiency is strongly correleated with the age of the property - older properties are on average less energy efficient, more modern properties are more energy efficient
-   Band C (69 and above) is the government target for efficient homes.
    -   If your property was built after 2003, you have a very high probability of being band C or higher
    -   As properties get older the variation in their efficiency gets greater, but the probability of being band C or above gets much lower.
    -   Any property built before World War II has a high probabilty of being below band C

## Some intitial analysis of the EPC dataset

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Tenure: Whether the house is owner-occupied, privately rented or socially rented is also very important - Social rented housing has far better energy efficiency than all other housing tenures
-   Various reasons for this:
    -   social landlords more conscious of the needs of residents, some large retrofit programmes
    -   social housing more likely to be flats

## Some intitial analysis of the EPC dataset

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The type of property - i.e. whether it is a flat, detached, semi-detached or terraced house is important (the fewer outside walls the better!)
-   Older detached housing with more external walls and larger floor areas has the worst energy efficieny - even some modern detached housing has poor energy efficiency (Bottom Right)
-   Terraced flats and masionettes with fewer external walls and smaller floor areas have the best energy efficiency, with even older properties more likely to be rated C or above than some more modern terraced and semi-detached housing

## Some intitial analysis of the EPC dataset

-   Depending on which part of the country you are living in, you are more likely to be living in a particular type and size of property
-   If we can account for the type, size, age and other characteristics of a property relative to energy efficiency, we can show where energy efficiency is better or worse than we would expect

## Some intitial analysis of the EPC dataset

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In this piece of analysis we built a statistical model that predicted building energy efficiency as a function of:
    -   age
    -   dwelling type
    -   tenure
    -   floor area
    -   and which Local Authority the property was found in
-   The map on the right shows, after controlling for the variables above, relative to Tower Hamlets (the local authority with the overall best Energy Efficiency in England), how many EPC points better or worse on average properties in each Local Authority are
-   The map on the left shows where real average EPC values are lower/worse (\<1 - red) or higher/better (\>1 - orange to blue) than we might expect, given the housing stock mix.
    -   Properties within boroughs in Central London, in particular, Islington, Hackney and Hammersmith and Fulham perform worse than expected, alongside Harlow in Essex, Eastleigh in Hampshire, Norwich, Lincoln and Sunderland
