-   The UK Government has legally binding targets under the Climate Change Act 2008 to reach 'net zero' carbon emissions by 2050

-   Heating (and , increasingly, cooling) Residential Buildings currently accounts for about 13.7% of the UK's total greenhouse gas emissions

-   While Greenhouse Gas emissions have reduced since 1990 (largely thanks to renewables becoming more important in generating electricity) housing is now responsible for a greater proportion of our total emissions than ever before - producing around 56 million tons of CO^2^ per year

-   Housing in the UK is some of the worst, overall, in Europe for emitting greenhouse gases.

-   Even after adjusting for population, UK housing stock is responsible for emitting far more CO2 than housing in very cold countries like Iceland, Sweden, Norway and Finland

## Leaky Homes

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In 2021, the National Housing Federation reported that a combination of gas central heating and poor insulation meant that as heat easily leaks from many of the UK's homes, it requires even more gas to heat them.

-   The average family or household in England is currently producing more CO^2^ every year by just living in their home than they are by driving their car!

-   Three in every five (60%) homeowners don't think their home energy use has much of an impact on carbon emissions. More than one in four homeowners (28%) have no plans to make "eco-upgrades" to their homes in the next ten years.

## How do we know how leaky our home is?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Energy Performance Certificates were introduced in England and Wales in August 2007
-   A valid certificate (they last for 10 years) is now required for any property sold or rented in the UK
-   Every property gets a current rating - A to G - alongside a potential rating, which relates to what it could achieve with better insulation, double glazing, etc.
-   EPCs are created by surveyors who use something called the 'Standard Assessment Procedure' (SAP) to rate the building. SAP accounts for things like:
    -   Size of building
    -   Age of Building
    -   Building materials used
    -   Glazing
    -   Heating and hot water type
    -   Type of lighting
-   The SAP is an imperfect science and prone to human error, but it's the best method currently available

## What does the government want?

-   The Clean Growth Strategy was published in October 2017 and includes several targets to improve energy efficiency:
    -   to upgrade all fuel poor homes to Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) band C by 2030;
    -   to upgrade as many homes as possible to EPC band C by 2035
    
But is this enough??

## How do we make our homes more energy efficient?

-   



## What needs to be done? Insulate Britain

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Pressure Group highlights that UK government doesn't have a long-term strategy or funding mechanism to upgrade/retrofit homes to meet our climate committments
-   Estimates that 1.5 homes per minute need to be retrofitted up until 2050 to hit our legally-binding net-zero target

## What other benefits can retrofitting our homes bring?

-   Health benefits. The Building Research Establishment estimates that poor housing costs the NHS Â£1.4bn per year in additional treatments, with excess cold causing the most problems
